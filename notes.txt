== How to Convert Default Pysmvt App to pysapp ==

1. add ElixirApp middleware
2. Settings inherit from pysapp settings
3. Add self.db.url to settings
4. Remove static, etc. routing routes (from one at least)
5. Add the pysapp as supporting app
6. Adjust template to use default CSS and remove default css from template.css
7. adjust default.html to have CP and user links in nav
8. add user settings so we don't get prompted on initmod
9. Add user message view to default template

== Steps for creating a working application ==
1. `pysmvt project -t pysapp <myapp>` replace <myapp> with your project name
2. answer the questions that come up
3. when prompted to overwrite, type `all y`
4. write down "Login Details", referred to hereafter as <user> & <pass>
5. `cd <myapp>-dist`
6. `python setup.py develop`
7. `cd <myapp>`
8. `pysmvt broadcast initdb` setup the database tables
9. `pysmvt broadcast initmod -p <user>` let modules set themselves up, use the
    settings profile for your user
10. `pysmvt broadcast initmod`
11. `pysmvt serve <user>` run a development http serve with the user's settings
    profile

== TODO ==
 * Get rid of template overrides
